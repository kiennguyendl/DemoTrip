Hoan Kiem Lake is also the site of the city’s own creation myth: the Legend of the Lake of the Recovered Sword. In the mid-15th century, the gods gave Emperor Le Thai To a magical sword to defeat Chinese invaders. While the emperor was boating on the lake one day, a giant tortoise reared up and snatched the sword, returning it to its rightful owners and ushering peace into the kingdom. Stroll around the lake in the early morning or evening to savor local life among the willow trees and see elders playing chess or practicing tai chi. In the center of the lake is the Tortoise Pagoda; on the northern part is Ngoc Son pagoda, reachable only by the stunning Bridge of the Rising Sun, a long, red arch typical of Chinese temple compounds. Ngoc Son is a working temple, meaning that you might walk into a local ceremony of chanting monks and kneeling supplicants, The temple grounds offer great views of the surrounding lake, and the little lakeside park on the island is a popular place for elderly men to enjoy a game of Chinese chess.

For a nominal fee, have you and your friends’ names done in Chinese characters, complete with the meanings of each symbol in English on the back (I’m “Wheat Love Machine “) or have a scroll done of significant Chinese characters such as “Heart, ” “Love, ” or “Determination” (whatever you think you might need).',

                                comment: "Explore the scenery of Halong Bay with a seaplane flight and cruise that shows you the beauty of this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Use the easy trip from Hanoi to learn about the pristine scenery, and then experience the timeless atmosphere amid the thousands of limestone karsts.\n" +
                                "After a morning pickup from your hotel, settle into an air-conditioned shuttle bus for the hourlong ride to Noi Bai International Airport. Here, you board your aircraft, a Cessna Grand Caravan equipped with floats to land and take off from the water. During the 45-minute flight, you can put on your audio headset and listen to commentary from your pilot as you admire the views of Hanoi and beyond.\n" +
                                "Experience the thrill of a water landing at the Tuan Chau Marina, where you transfer from the seaplane for a cruise on Ha Long Bay. Enjoy a Vietnamese-style lunch, visit Paradise Cave, and explore the region by kayak for an up-close look at its sea caves, limestone karsts, and secluded lagoons.\n" +
                                "In the afternoon, turn back to Hanoi by private car."

Set sail and admire the glistening jade waters surrounding your ship on your way to Kiem Lam. You have the chance to hop into a kayak, take a dip in the tranquil, clear bay or enjoy the stunning natural beauty from the deck. Settle in near dusk to catch a breathtaking sunset on the horizon. Later in the evening you have the option to give squid fishing a try with the guidance of the crew.\n" +

Your next stop at Soi Sim Island provides a rewarding opportunity to hike to the peak for excellent bay views.\n" +

After an incredible water puppet show, take to the streets of the Old Quarter for delicious samples of Vietnamese specialties, capped off with a lakeside stroll.\n" +
                                "Enjoy convenient pickup from your hotel and travel to the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre for a one-of-a-kind show. A traditional art dating back to the 11th century, water puppetry features lacquered wood puppets, who are controlled by puppeteers via bamboo rods, on a stage made of water. Watch a fascinating performance complete with live orchestration and learn about Vietnamese folklore and legends.\n" +
                                "After the show, head out into the streets of Hanoi's Old Quarter for a bite to eat. Tempting aromas waft through the air around you, beckoning you to try mouthwatering dishes like freshly grilled meat skewers, bánh cuốn (white rice noodles served with seasoned pork, mushrooms, shallots, and dipping sauce), and addictive fried banana cakes. Cap off your tasty expedition with egg coffee, a decadently rich drink consisting of strong coffee topped with sweet, custardy egg cream.\n" +

Also known as the Hanoi Citadel, many artefacts and items dating back to between the 6th and 20th centuries were excavated in 2004, including foundations of old palaces, ancient roads, ponds and wells. On top of these discoveries, archaeologists also found bronze coins, ceramics and pottery from China and many places in Asia, all of which demonstrate a close trading relationship in the area. Visitors should head for the display room that features interesting excavated items and mock-ups of the citadel itself.\n",

A notable attraction in the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long was the Hanoi Flag Tower, a renovated 40-metre-tall stone fortress offering expansive views of Ba Dinh Square and Hanoi City Centre. Located in Ba Dinh District, entrance to the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long is priced at VND 30,000 and it is open from 08:00 to 17:00 every day except Monday. This prominent site is also within a 15-minute walk from attractions such as Quan Thanh Temple, Vietnam Military History Museum and Cua Bac Church\n",

                        hightligh: "Shows at this modern theatre are performed in a pool of water as the stage for the puppets. The puppets are controlled by no more than eight puppeteers hiding behind a bamboo screen. The renowned Thang Long Water Puppet show is considered to be one of the cultural highlights of Northern Vietnam dating back to a tradition that first started in the Red River Delta. Today’s performances usually include a number of short sketches rather than one long story, taking the audience on a journey of ancient village life, agricultural harvests and dances of mythical creatures. Most shows also feature the famous Legend of the Restored Sword of King Le which tells the tale of Hoan Kiem Lake and the giant tortoise. The live music plays an integral part of the show with singers often shouting words of encouragement to the puppets.\n",
                        decription: "The world-famous Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre in Hanoi has its roots in an art form that dates back to the 11th century. The tradition of water puppet theatre stems from a time when rice paddy fields were flooded and villagers would make entertainment by standing in the waist-deep water with the puppets performing over the water. Using large rods to support the puppets it appeared as if they were moving across the water with the puppeteers hidden behind a screen.\n" +
                        "This tradition is unique to North Vietnam but has recently found fame on stages all over the world; so it’s a rare treat to see the puppets perform in their original location at the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre. Performances are accompanied by a Vietnamese orchestra playing traditional music using drums, wooden bells, horns, bamboo flutes and cymbals. There are also authentic Vietnamese operatic songs telling the story that is being acted out by the puppets. Most of the shows recount Vietnamese folk tales and legends with topics including the celebration of the rice harvest depicted in a humorous fashion.\n",

The granite building meant a great deal for many locals as it ensures that their beloved leader ‘lives on forever’. Security is tight and visitors should dress with respect (no shorts, sleeveless shirts and miniskirts) and everyone has to deposit their bags and cameras before getting in. Visitors are not allowed to stop and hold the constant queue up as the place is constantly busy. Uncle Ho’s remains are sent yearly to Russia for maintenance therefore the mausoleum is closed usually from October onwards. It’s best to recheck with your hotel tour desk before visiting. Admission is free but donations are accepted.\n",

It is the final resting place of Ho Chi Minh, the most iconic and popular leader of Vietnam, known to his people as ‘Uncle Ho’. His body is preserved here in a glass case at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in central Hanoi (albeit against his wishes). For visitors, a trip to Uncle Ho’s final resting place can be an extraordinary experience as it is not just an average attraction; it’s a part of a unique history.\n",

The Hanoi building went into a state of decline prior to being renovated and brought up to date in 1997 which included the installation of state-of-the-art equipment and the renewal of some of the interior decorations. These improvements returned the opera house to its former glory which now sees international artists including violinist Hilary Hahn and pianist Wolfgang Glemser take to the stage in addition to home-grown talent. Vietnamese entertainers perform songs, classical music, dance, drama and contemporary performances from superstars such as singer My Linh. The Hanoi Opera House offers a superb setting in which to see any live show. The stage is three metres high and there are three storeys in total so a wonderful experience is guaranteed regardless of your seating arrangements.",
                                        decription: "The beautiful Hanoi Opera House was built in 1911 by the then ruling French. It’s a phenomenal piece of neo-classical French architecture featuring Gothic themes on the doors and domes with pillars, shuttered windows, balconies and a glass room. Musicians, actors and dancers play to a 600-strong audience delivering powerful operatic and classical performances, making it a very popular theatrical attraction. The Hanoi Opera House is the biggest theatre in Vietnam and speaks volumes as historical and cultural evidence of Vietnam under French rule. The interior is even more magnificent than the exterior with many arguing it is aesthetically even more appealing than the Paris Opera House. Visitors today will be entertained at this architectural landmark which features a range of events including local Vietnamese opera, traditional folk music, ballets and many international concerts.",

Also known as the Hanoi Citadel, many artefacts and items dating back to between the 6th and 20th centuries were excavated in 2004, including foundations of old palaces, ancient roads, ponds and wells. On top of these discoveries, archaeologists also found bronze coins, ceramics and pottery from China and many places in Asia, all of which demonstrate a close trading relationship in the area. Visitors should head for the display room that features interesting excavated items and mock-ups of the citadel itself.\n",

                                        hightligh: "Shows at this modern theatre are performed in a pool of water as the stage for the puppets. The puppets are controlled by no more than eight puppeteers hiding behind a bamboo screen. The renowned Thang Long Water Puppet show is considered to be one of the cultural highlights of Northern Vietnam dating back to a tradition that first started in the Red River Delta. Today’s performances usually include a number of short sketches rather than one long story, taking the audience on a journey of ancient village life, agricultural harvests and dances of mythical creatures. Most shows also feature the famous Legend of the Restored Sword of King Le which tells the tale of Hoan Kiem Lake and the giant tortoise. The live music plays an integral part of the show with singers often shouting words of encouragement to the puppets.\n",
                                        decription: "The world-famous Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre in Hanoi has its roots in an art form that dates back to the 11th century. The tradition of water puppet theatre stems from a time when rice paddy fields were flooded and villagers would make entertainment by standing in the waist-deep water with the puppets performing over the water. Using large rods to support the puppets it appeared as if they were moving across the water with the puppeteers hidden behind a screen.\n" +
                                        "This tradition is unique to North Vietnam but has recently found fame on stages all over the world; so it’s a rare treat to see the puppets perform in their original location at the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre. Performances are accompanied by a Vietnamese orchestra playing traditional music using drums, wooden bells, horns, bamboo flutes and cymbals. There are also authentic Vietnamese operatic songs telling the story that is being acted out by the puppets. Most of the shows recount Vietnamese folk tales and legends with topics including the celebration of the rice harvest depicted in a humorous fashion.\n",

The granite building meant a great deal for many locals as it ensures that their beloved leader ‘lives on forever’. Security is tight and visitors should dress with respect (no shorts, sleeveless shirts and miniskirts) and everyone has to deposit their bags and cameras before getting in. Visitors are not allowed to stop and hold the constant queue up as the place is constantly busy. Uncle Ho’s remains are sent yearly to Russia for maintenance therefore the mausoleum is closed usually from October onwards. It’s best to recheck with your hotel tour desk before visiting. Admission is free but donations are accepted.\n",

It is the final resting place of Ho Chi Minh, the most iconic and popular leader of Vietnam, known to his people as ‘Uncle Ho’. His body is preserved here in a glass case at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in central Hanoi (albeit against his wishes). For visitors, a trip to Uncle Ho’s final resting place can be an extraordinary experience as it is not just an average attraction; it’s a part of a unique history.\n",

Inside the cave are many statues carved from green stone which decorate an intricate shrine, including one of Lord Buddha and another of the Buddhist goddess Quan Am. Smooth stalactites and stalagmites also fill the cave which are constantly touched by pilgrims believing them to deliver miracles and good luck. You will find the temple very cool inside and also very busy especially during the days of the Chua Huong festival which lasts from January to April. It’s well worth taking time to stop and enjoy the view en-route to the temple as the scenery is very interesting, dotted with fruit trees including apricots and medicinal herbs grown by local farmers. Other temples to see within the complex include the Vong Temple, Thuyet Kinh Cave and Thien Son Pagoda.\n",
                                        decription: "The Perfume Pagoda, known locally as Chua Huong or ‘inner temple’, is at the centre of a very revered and sacred site featuring a maze of mainly Buddhist temples built into the limestone cliffs of Huong Tich. At the heart of this complex lies the Perfume Temple or Perfume Pagoda in the Huong Tich Cave. It is believed that the first temple was built here in the 15th century, although legend declares that the site was actually discovered over 2,000 years ago by a Buddhist monk who was meditating nearby. The mountain foothills are an area of great natural and spiritual beauty filled with streams, tropical plants and temples. There are many pagodas to visit, each offering a different shrine, most of which are Buddhist although one or two are animist. The Perfume Pagoda attracts pilgrims and tourists seeking good luck from the stalagmites and stalactites inside the cave which have been named according to the individual blessing they can bestow. Dun Tien offers prosperity and Nui Co offers the chance of giving birth to a girl whilst Dun Gao translates as a ‘rice stack’ to those hoping for a bountiful harvest.\n",

                                        hightligh: "Ngoc Son Temple was built in the 18th century on Jade Island in the centre of the ‘Lake of the Returned Sword’ or Hoan Kiem Lake. Legend describes how an emperor was once given a magical sword which helped him defeat the Chinese Ming Dynasty and in doing so saw the return of the Golden Turtle God to the lake. Today ‘Turtle Tower’ stands close to the lake in memory of this legend. There are also endangered large soft-shell turtles swimming in the lake, and to see one of these gentle giants is considered very auspicious. The name of the temple translates to ‘Temple of the Jade Mountain’ and is predominately dedicated to war hero General Tran Hung Dao who defeated an armed force of 300,000 soldiers sent by Mongolian Emperor Kublai Khan in the 13th century to invade Vietnam. Also inside the pagoda are a large bronze bust and other deities. There are altars dedicated to Tran Hung Dao, some ancient artefacts including ceramics and a preserved specimen of a giant turtle found in the lake weighing 250kg ",
                                        decription: "Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi attracts tourists and locals looking to get away from the noise and frenetic pace of the city. Peaceful and quiet, the lake surrounds Ngoc Son Temple, a pagoda sitting in the centre on a small island. The temple attracts many visitors and was built in commemoration of the 13th century military leader Tran Hung Dao who was renowned for his bravery in the battle against the Yuan Dynasty. Homage is also paid to scholar Van Xuong and Confucian master Nguyen Van Sieu. The island on which the temple is built is known as Jade Island and is accessible by the iconic Huc Bridge or Rising Sun Bridge which is a charming scarlet-painted wooden bridge of classical Vietnamese design. The pagoda is also guarded by two towering posts decorated with Chinese writing. The lake and temple are probably the most famous places in Hanoi city in which to rest and enjoy the view and are a great place to sit back and watch the locals.",

Highly recommended dishes include tiet canh (duck blood soup), fried frog, bun cha (marinated grilled pork served with noodles), and banh cuon (rolled cake).   Surrounding Dong Xuan Market are many more shops where you can purchase traditional Dong Ho drawings, Bat Trang ceramics, Binh Da embroideries and laces, and sand paintings. Within walking distance of Hoan Kiem Lake, Dong Xuan Market is a must-visit if you’re looking to experience the local lifestyle (you might even end up leaving with a pair of cheap sunglasses and a Vietnamese conical hat)",

It’s also known as Hanoi’s largest indoor market, offering a wide range of goods such as fresh produce, souvenirs, accessories and clothing, as well as electronic and household appliances. Similar to most markets in Southeast Asia, Dong Xuan Market has a bustling wet market section on the ground floor, where locals shop for seafood, meat, and vegetables while the back section sells an array of pets (cats, dogs, and fish) and fresh flowers from all across Vietnam. If you’re looking to shop for souvenirs, head to the upper levels, where you can find numerous stalls selling tee shirts, fabrics, school uniforms, handbags, handicrafts, all of which are sold at wholesale prices.",

                                        hightligh: "Originally created as a hill station during the French Colonial era, Ba Vi National Park has always been an excellent source of medicinal plants for the Dao ethnic group. Walking and hiking opportunities are popular in this area of lush tropical foliage with plenty of forest trails and mountain slopes. In addition there is also a bird garden and an orchid garden, although the main attraction is the temple. It takes about 30 minutes of hard climb to make it to the temple but you are additionally well rewarded with panoramic views of the Red River Valley and beyond. The outlook is best from April through to December when even Hanoi can be seen in the distance. The national park offers lodging at Tan Da Spa Resort where you can experience hot springs, mud baths, wet steam baths and herbal baths for individuals, couples or families. The resort is built in the style of an ancient palace and reminiscent of the houses once found in the Vietnamese northern delta region.",
                                        decription: "Ba Vi National Park is one of Vietnam’s most famous areas of outstanding natural beauty, and is centered around a three-peaked mountain jutting steeply out of the landscape. The national park offers a great escape from the city with cool fresh mountain air in a mystical atmospheric backdrop of clouds, jungle and tropical rainforest. There is also a spa resort nestled at the foot of the mountain offering a host of natural therapies in an absolutely stunning setting. The three mountain summits are Dinh Vua which is the highest at 1,296m, Tan Vien which is 1,226m and Ngoc Hoa the smallest at 1,131m. Together they form a three humped crest which is often obscured by clouds at the highest point due to the varied climate at the park. Pilgrims and tourists alike usually make the walk to the summit of the Tan Vien peak where an 11th sacred century shrine stands in memory of the Mountain God. There are also superb tropical forest views and vistas all the way to Hanoi to be enjoyed from this peak. The fast-flowing Da River is located on one side of the national park; there are also several streams running through the park.\n",

Set sail and admire the glistening jade waters surrounding your ship on your way to Kiem Lam. You have the chance to hop into a kayak, take a dip in the tranquil, clear bay or enjoy the stunning natural beauty from the deck. Settle in near dusk to catch a breathtaking sunset on the horizon. Later in the evening you have the option to give squid fishing a try with the guidance of the crew.\n" +

Then delight in a fresh breakfast as you continue north to a fishing village at Ba Hang. Transfer into a small sampan boat to navigate through the area’s mysterious caves and grottos.

Venture along the banks of the Red River, by flower gardens, and around West Lake. Sip a cup of coffee and admire the views before pedaling back to the city, past the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum.\n" +
                                                "After a quick safety briefing, hop on your bicycle and ride away from Hanoi’s busy Old Quarter into the surrounding countryside. Riding with your small group of 8 people, see local residents going about their daily lives as you pedal along the Red River, visit a pottery village to admire ceramic pots, and pass by floating houses and commercial flower gardens with colorful and fragrant blooms.\n" +
                                                "Next, take in the view as you pedal around West Lake, Hanoi’s biggest lake and a popular recreation spot. Take a break to rest and sip a coffee at one of the lakeside cafés before you bicycle past the famous Ho Chi Minh Complex and make your way back to your starting point."

Each performance gives you a chance to experience the life and understand the soul of Vietnamese people.\n" +

Open only on weekends, the market lets you feel the busy atmosphere of its many small stalls, lights, and local goods such as souvenirs, T-shirts, bags, lanterns, key rings, and toys. You can also choose to just walk through the streets, and buy an egg coffee at a special coffee shop nearby."

While this incident was refuted by the Catholic Church of Vietnam, thousands of visitors still flock to this statue in hopes of witnessing a miracle.   Aside from its status as one of Ho Chi Minh City’s most prominent attractions, Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral still serves as a religious institution for the local population. The best time to visit is during Sunday mass at 09:30. As with any holy places around the world, do dress appropriately and refrain from disturbing the worshippers when you’re exploring (and photographing) Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral.\n",
                        decription: "Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral, built in the late 1880s by French colonists, is one of the few remaining strongholds of Catholicism in the largely Buddhist Vietnam. Located in Paris Square, the name Notre Dame was given after the installation of the statue ‘Peaceful Notre Dame’ in 1959. In 1962, the Vatican conferred the Cathedral status as a basilica and gave it the official name of Saigon Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica. Measuring almost 60 metres in height, the cathedral’s distinctive neo-Romanesque features include the all-red brick façade (which were imported from Marseille), stained glass windows, two bell towers containing six bronze bells that still ring to this day, and a peaceful garden setting in the middle of downtown Ho Chi Minh City District 1.\n",

While this incident was refuted by the Catholic Church of Vietnam, thousands of visitors still flock to this statue in hopes of witnessing a miracle.   Aside from its status as one of Ho Chi Minh City’s most prominent attractions, Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral still serves as a religious institution for the local population. The best time to visit is during Sunday mass at 09:30. As with any holy places around the world, do dress appropriately and refrain from disturbing the worshippers when you’re exploring (and photographing) Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral.\n",
                        decription: "Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral, built in the late 1880s by French colonists, is one of the few remaining strongholds of Catholicism in the largely Buddhist Vietnam. Located in Paris Square, the name Notre Dame was given after the installation of the statue ‘Peaceful Notre Dame’ in 1959. In 1962, the Vatican conferred the Cathedral status as a basilica and gave it the official name of Saigon Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica. Measuring almost 60 metres in height, the cathedral’s distinctive neo-Romanesque features include the all-red brick façade (which were imported from Marseille), stained glass windows, two bell towers containing six bronze bells that still ring to this day, and a peaceful garden setting in the middle of downtown Ho Chi Minh City District 1.\n",

                        hightligh: "The Reunification Palace is a five-storey building with the basement housing a warren of tunnels, a war room and telecommunications centre. The war command room still has maps on its walls and period telecommunications equipment on display, whilst adjoining basement rooms feature war propaganda materials. Other areas of interest are the third floor featuring a card playing room, a fourth floor which once had a casino and was used for entertaining guests and a rooftop terrace with a heliport. The Reunification Palace entered the world history books in 1975 when a Vietnamese Air Force pilot (who was also a communist spy) flew an aircraft over the palace with an attempt to bomb it. Although no real damage was caused this was a significant step towards the fall of Saigon and the ending of the Vietnamese War. On 30th April in 1975 at 10:45 a North Vietnamese Army Tank rammed the main gates and entered the palace grounds before hanging its flag on the balcony to declare victory for the communist party and thus ending the Vietnam War. Meanwhile staff escaped from the rooftop minutes before the palace was overrun, known as Operation Frequent Wind this was part of history’s biggest ever helicopter evacuation and included the departure of General Thieu.\n",
                        decription: "The iconic Reunification Palace made its name in global history when in 1975 a tank belonging to the North Vietnamese Army crashed through its main gate – thus signifying the end of the Vietnam War. This image is one of the most famous pictures depicting the Reunification Palace which has seen a rich and varied history and once served as the base of the US-backed Vietnamese General Ngo Dinh Diem during the Vietnam War, until his assassination in 1963. The palace is like a time capsule frozen in 1975 with two of the original tanks used in the capture of the palace parked in the grounds. Originally the site of the Nordom Palace also known as the Governor’s Palace its first role was as a home and workplace for the then French Governor of Cochinchina. The Reunification Palace is a landmark not to be missed by any tourist visiting Ho Chi Minh City. Surrounded by lush tropical gardens, the palace hides secret rooms, antique furniture and a command bunker within its eerie corridors. The Reunification Palace is still in use to host occasions including APEC summits and national events of significant importance.\n",

                        hightligh: "Today, it is one of Ho Chi Minh’s most iconic attractions where visitors can enjoy activities such as following the claustrophobia-inducing routes of the underground army, firing an M16 assault rifle, as well sampling meals that the underground soldiers had to live with years ago. The tunnels have been coated with cement and widened so it is not quite the harrowing experience it would have been all those years ago, plus there are emergency exit points every ten metres for safety. Still, during the 100 metres of tunnel you get a sense of what it would have been like during the war.\n Prior to entering the underground tunnels, visitors are presented with a short film of the Chu Chi Tunnels so that they have an understanding of how the tunnel system actually works. There is also a shooting range on site. Those who want to fire an M16 rifle are required to pay VND 35,000 per bullet with a minimum of 10 bullets. The Chu Chi Tunnels are a 40-minute drive from Ho Chi Minh City and there are numerous tour operators that can arrange for a half-day excursion for about VND 825,000 onwards. Do note that the crawl through the underground tunnels may not be suitable for visitors with respiratory difficulties.\n",
                        decription: "Chu Chi Tunnels are part of a massive war museum that offers a sneak-peek at the underground life of Vietnamese soldiers back in 1948. Located 70km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City, the historical site comprises more than 120km of underground tunnels with several trapdoors, living areas, kitchens, storage facilities, armoury, hospitals, and command centres. After the end of the war against French invaders, Chu Chi Tunnels were also utilised and expanded during the American War by incorporating effective air filtration systems, which helped Vietnamese soldiers survive the Chu Chi carpet-bombing by the Americans. As they were built so deep underground, military tanks could pass overhead without causing any damage to the tunnels.\n",

                        hightligh: "Today, it is one of Ho Chi Minh’s most iconic attractions where visitors can enjoy activities such as following the claustrophobia-inducing routes of the underground army, firing an M16 assault rifle, as well sampling meals that the underground soldiers had to live with years ago. The tunnels have been coated with cement and widened so it is not quite the harrowing experience it would have been all those years ago, plus there are emergency exit points every ten metres for safety. Still, during the 100 metres of tunnel you get a sense of what it would have been like during the war.\n Prior to entering the underground tunnels, visitors are presented with a short film of the Chu Chi Tunnels so that they have an understanding of how the tunnel system actually works. There is also a shooting range on site. Those who want to fire an M16 rifle are required to pay VND 35,000 per bullet with a minimum of 10 bullets. The Chu Chi Tunnels are a 40-minute drive from Ho Chi Minh City and there are numerous tour operators that can arrange for a half-day excursion for about VND 825,000 onwards. Do note that the crawl through the underground tunnels may not be suitable for visitors with respiratory difficulties.\n",
                        decription: "Chu Chi Tunnels are part of a massive war museum that offers a sneak-peek at the underground life of Vietnamese soldiers back in 1948. Located 70km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City, the historical site comprises more than 120km of underground tunnels with several trapdoors, living areas, kitchens, storage facilities, armoury, hospitals, and command centres. After the end of the war against French invaders, Chu Chi Tunnels were also utilised and expanded during the American War by incorporating effective air filtration systems, which helped Vietnamese soldiers survive the Chu Chi carpet-bombing by the Americans. As they were built so deep underground, military tanks could pass overhead without causing any damage to the tunnels.\n",

We will then get creative by sketching what we want to make out of clay. Over music, laughter and some more tea (artichoke tea is our favorite), we\'ll transform our ideas from paper to clay! During this time, maybe our two cats, Sriracha and Shiro can lend a helping paw to your handicraft :) After we finish with our own creations, we\'ll take you to have a delicious local lunch nearby where we\'ll discuss the growing local art, design and creative community in Saigon.',

Although the architecture is distinctly French, the large portrait of Ho Chi Minh hanging high above everyone at the far end of the building reminds everyone we are definitely in Vietnam. Painted onto walls overhead are two maps of the region; one of them showing the telegraph lines that crisscross Vietnam and Cambodia and the other displaying a map of the Saigon region in 1892. \n" +

There are two wings branching out from the main office, selling souvenirs, postcards and lacquerware but the prices are inflated and the same products can probably be found elsewhere for a better price.",

While this incident was refuted by the Catholic Church of Vietnam, thousands of visitors still flock to this statue in hopes of witnessing a miracle.   Aside from its status as one of Ho Chi Minh City’s most prominent attractions, Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral still serves as a religious institution for the local population. The best time to visit is during Sunday mass at 09:30. As with any holy places around the world, do dress appropriately and refrain from disturbing the worshippers when you’re exploring (and photographing) Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral.\n",
                                        decription: "Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral, built in the late 1880s by French colonists, is one of the few remaining strongholds of Catholicism in the largely Buddhist Vietnam. Located in Paris Square, the name Notre Dame was given after the installation of the statue ‘Peaceful Notre Dame’ in 1959. In 1962, the Vatican conferred the Cathedral status as a basilica and gave it the official name of Saigon Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica. Measuring almost 60 metres in height, the cathedral’s distinctive neo-Romanesque features include the all-red brick façade (which were imported from Marseille), stained glass windows, two bell towers containing six bronze bells that still ring to this day, and a peaceful garden setting in the middle of downtown Ho Chi Minh City District 1.\n",

The war command room still has maps on its walls and period telecommunications equipment on display, whilst adjoining basement rooms feature war propaganda materials. Other areas of interest are the third floor featuring a card playing room, a fourth floor which once had a casino and was used for entertaining guests and a rooftop terrace with a heliport. The Reunification Palace entered the world history books in 1975 when a Vietnamese Air Force pilot (who was also a communist spy) flew an aircraft over the palace with an attempt to bomb it. Although no real damage was caused this was a significant step towards the fall of Saigon and the ending of the Vietnamese War. On 30th April in 1975 at 10:45 a North Vietnamese Army Tank rammed the main gates and entered the palace grounds before hanging its flag on the balcony to declare victory for the communist party and thus ending the Vietnam War. Meanwhile staff escaped from the rooftop minutes before the palace was overrun, known as Operation Frequent Wind this was part of history’s biggest ever helicopter evacuation and included the departure of General Thieu.\n",
                                        decription: "The iconic Reunification Palace made its name in global history when in 1975 a tank belonging to the North Vietnamese Army crashed through its main gate – thus signifying the end of the Vietnam War. This image is one of the most famous pictures depicting the Reunification Palace which has seen a rich and varied history and once served as the base of the US-backed Vietnamese General Ngo Dinh Diem during the Vietnam War, until his assassination in 1963. The palace is like a time capsule frozen in 1975 with two of the original tanks used in the capture of the palace parked in the grounds. Originally the site of the Nordom Palace also known as the Governor’s Palace its first role was as a home and workplace for the then French Governor of Cochinchina. The Reunification Palace is a landmark not to be missed by any tourist visiting Ho Chi Minh City. Surrounded by lush tropical gardens, the palace hides secret rooms, antique furniture and a command bunker within its eerie corridors. The Reunification Palace is still in use to host occasions including APEC summits and national events of significant importance.\n",

The tunnels have been coated with cement and widened so it is not quite the harrowing experience it would have been all those years ago, plus there are emergency exit points every ten metres for safety. Still, during the 100 metres of tunnel you get a sense of what it would have been like during the war.\n Prior to entering the underground tunnels, visitors are presented with a short film of the Chu Chi Tunnels so that they have an understanding of how the tunnel system actually works. There is also a shooting range on site. Those who want to fire an M16 rifle are required to pay VND 35,000 per bullet with a minimum of 10 bullets. The Chu Chi Tunnels are a 40-minute drive from Ho Chi Minh City and there are numerous tour operators that can arrange for a half-day excursion for about VND 825,000 onwards. Do note that the crawl through the underground tunnels may not be suitable for visitors with respiratory difficulties.\n",
                                        decription: "Chu Chi Tunnels are part of a massive war museum that offers a sneak-peek at the underground life of Vietnamese soldiers back in 1948. Located 70km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City, the historical site comprises more than 120km of underground tunnels with several trapdoors, living areas, kitchens, storage facilities, armoury, hospitals, and command centres. After the end of the war against French invaders, Chu Chi Tunnels were also utilised and expanded during the American War by incorporating effective air filtration systems, which helped Vietnamese soldiers survive the Chu Chi carpet-bombing by the Americans. As they were built so deep underground, military tanks could pass overhead without causing any damage to the tunnels.\n",

We will then get creative by sketching what we want to make out of clay. Over music, laughter and some more tea (artichoke tea is our favorite), we\'ll transform our ideas from paper to clay! During this time, maybe our two cats, Sriracha and Shiro can lend a helping paw to your handicraft :) After we finish with our own creations, we\'ll take you to have a delicious local lunch nearby where we\'ll discuss the growing local art, design and creative community in Saigon.',

Therefore, we will meet at 6 AM, when the air is still crisp, at a wet market by the backpacker district and jog our way around the city center so you can experience real life in Ho Chi Minh City...and hopefully you\'ll love it as much as I do. As a travel entrepreneur and currently operating a travel experience company in this city, I can share a very unique perspective about this city that\'s beyond the typical city tour that travelers can sign up for. We will walk, jog, run, and talk about the city, the people, the history, and maybe even entrepreneurship, which is something I have taken on, full blast. Lastly, 100% of all proceeds will go towards a local charity.',

                        hightligh: "Once listed in Forbes Magazine as one of the 'World's Most Luxurious Beaches', the stunning sands of My Khe Beach offer surfers and sun seekers a gloriously unspoilt hideaway with a host of big brand hotels such as Raffles and Hyatt opening or due to open very soon. The My Khe Beach area was first flung into the spotlight thanks to the My Khe Beach television show broadcast on American networks highlighting US Vietnam War soldiers enjoying rest and play in Da Nang. After the war, the beach became a well-known spot on the backpacker trail before heading upmarket to today's more glamorous resort scene. My Khe Beach benefits from being perfectly located at the heart of World Heritage sites - the ancient port of Hoi An, the mysterious Phing Nga Caves, the home place of the Champa population and the revered imperial city of Hue are all easily accessible. My Khe Beach is also reaping the rewards of an increasing number of international flight connections from Singapore, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City to name a few.",
                        decription: "Considered to be Vietnam's most picturesque beach, the white sandy 20-mile stretch of My Khe Beach was named by the American troops who visited during the Vietnam War for R&R. It offers excellent surfing from September just off the shores of Danang. There are also a number of high-end resorts within the vicinity should you be in need of pampering with most offering a rich choice of treatments at their spas and a range of dining options. Sunbathing and surfing aside, there are a host of historical sites situated close by including the port of Hoi An which is only 10 minutes away by bus and offers wonderfully preserved merchant houses and small alleyways to explore. Hoi An is also a superb place to get anything you desire tailor made usually within 12 hours, and while you wait it’s definitely recommended that you try some local delights including very fresh shrimp pancakes.",

                        hightligh: "According to ancient folklore, a dragon emerged from the water on Non Nuoc Beach and laid an egg. A thousand days and a thousand nights followed before the egg hatched, and out stepped a beautiful girl. The fragments of the shell were left on the beach and eventually grew into the five mystical Marble Mountains. Today, one of the most popular highlights is climbing up the Marble Mountains and enjoying spectacular views across Non Nuoc, also known as My Khe Beach. The Mountain of Water which is home to pagodas dating back to the 17th century and a number of caves is one the most frequented climbs with a steep hike up stone steps to Tam Quan Gate and its superb vistas to Mount Kim Son or Metal Mountain and the coastline from the Riverview Tower located next to the gate. The Riverview Tower dates back to the 18th century and the reign of the Emperor Minh Mang. Close by is Van Nguyet Grotto which is a nice resting spot where you can grab a fresh coconut to drink. The Lantern Cave is also worth a look, small but deep and filled with lava along with Am Phu Cave which heads down to a very scenic viewpoint. Remarks: You should allow up to four hours to explore all of Marble Mountains so its good to start early when it is not so hot and of course wear comfortable shoes, and if you can, bring a torch. Vietnamese children sell souvenirs at Marble Mountains and you can expect to be hassled until you've either bought a gift or 'tipped' them a few dollars for a 'guided tour'. Price Range: There is a $1 entrance fee to Marble Mountain and an additional $1 cost for entrance to the cave at the foot of the mountains",
                        decription: "A cluster of five hills made from limestone and marble, Marble Mountains are a well-known pilgrimage site with peaks, caves, tunnels and temples all just waiting to be discovered. Named after the elements metal, wood, water, fire and earth, Marble Mountains exist in a coastal area that is renowned for stone-cutting and sculpture about 9km south of Danang. The caves within the mountains hold many secrets including bullet holes from when troops used to spy on the US soldiers relaxing on My Khe Beach below and buildings standing within the caves and grottoes. There are also a host of Buddhist sanctuaries and places of worship dotted across the mountains which are a much-visited spiritual site. There are many pagoda temples and even a special circular cave featuring a chimney leading to the summit with spectacular panoramic views.",

On weekends and annual festivities, the state-of-the-art bridge is also scheduled to spit water or breathe fire from its mouth from 21:00 onwards. There are also plenty of riverfront bars, restaurants, and cafes offering terrace seats that overlook Vietnam’s longest bridge. Alternatively, you can opt to sit at the waterfront (where marble carvings of animals and deities are set along the Han River) to enjoy the view.",
                        decription: "Dragon Bridge in Da Nang is the longest bridge in Vietnam, offering a dazzling display of lights, fire, and water that no first-time visitor to Da Nang should miss out on. Measuring at 666 metres in length, it is located in Da Nang City and constructed in the shape of a golden dragon. The six-lane bridge crosses the Han River, serving as direct routes to My Khe Beach and Non Nuoc Beach as well as a popular spot amongst travelling photographers. Dragon Bridge was officially opened in 2013 after a two-year-long construction, commemorating the 38th anniversary of Da Nang City’s liberation. According to local beliefs, which date back to the Ly Dynasty, the dragon is a significant symbol of power, nobility and good fortune.",

                        hightligh: "The pass also hosts the ancient Tran Dynasty’s Hai Van Gate, Hai Van Tunnel (the longest in ASEAN), wartime gun towers, and a decrepit French-built fort that was later used as a bunker by South Vietnamese and US armies during the Vietnam War. Prior to the construction of the Hai Van Tunnel, the mountain pass was notorious for its fair share of fatal accidents – look out for small altars set along the roadside that are dedicated to perished victims. A motorcycle trip between Da Nang and Hue through Hai Van Pass takes between three and five hours, longer if you stop for seafood and coffee along the coastline. Priced between VND 150,000 to VND 200,000 per day, motorbikes can be rented from numerous hotels and tour operators in Da Nang City. Aside from requiring the use of a powerful bike, do note that Hai Van Pass motorcycle tours can be challenging for new riders – expect uphill slopes, an average temperature of 17°C, and rainy weather if you’re travelling between the months of September and March. Driving licenses are required by law and do check your insurance to see if you’re covered before… if not, go at your own risk!",
                        decription: "Hai Van Pass or Sea Clouds Pass offers an impressive landscape of verdant mountains and clear blue skies, overlooking Da Nang City, Tien Sa Port, Son Tra Peninsula, and South China Sea. Crossing over a spur of Truong Son mountain range between Thua Thien-Hue Province and Da Nang City, it stands at 500m above sea level, making it the highest pass in Vietnam. The 25 kilometre-long mountain pass is popular amongst thrill-seeking motorcyclists due to its winding roads, sudden curves and blind corners, while its lookout point offers gorgeous views of Da Nang Bay.",

                        hightligh: "The Kingdom of Champa governed Southern Vietnam from 192 A.D to 1697 and left behind a legacy of unique Cham motifs and Hindu-flavoured architecture defining this period. Examples of this style can be seen in the temples and towers decorating the coastal and mountain areas of Quang Nam, Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan, Khanh Hoa and Danang which is where the museum is also situated. The museum itself is also a fine example of Cham architecture with flowing simple lines, designed by the French architects Delaval and Auclair. Most of the artwork in the museum from this period takes the form of sculpture with a decidedly feminine feel and was gathered from Quang Binh up to Binh Dinh prior to the Cham Museum opening at the end of the 19th century. In addition to the abundance of Hindu-influenced pieces there are also some that have evidently drawn inspiration from Buddhism including altars and deities. This range in religion reflects the eight centuries of Champa life from its start through to its height and then decline, with some of the more decadent pieces coming from the Champa golden age.",
                        decription: "With their roots dating back as far as 192 AD, Vietnam's indigenous Cham people lived an Indian way of life in both culture and language. The Cham Museum in Danang is dedicated to this period and the Champa existence which began predominantly in the coastal areas of Vietnam. Housing the largest exhibition of Cham sculpture in the world, the museum displays almost 300 terracotta and stone works of art ranging from the 7th to the 15th centuries. Many of the exhibits are considered masterpieces of their field showcased according to the region in which they were found with a total of ten separate interior exhibition rooms. All of the sculptures on display fall into one of the following sections – icon, pedestal, pediment, or fragment, with the area in which they were found determining where they are exhibited. When you've finished browsing the internal creations, step outside to appreciate the building itself carefully crafted with objects of worship including idols and holy animals surrounded by flowers, leaves and turrets all symbols of Hinduism.",

                                "Set out from your hotel as the morning sun brings the city to light and head to Tao Dan Park, where locals practice their morning exercises, including tai chi, aerobics, and badminton. At a small pagoda, you can learn about the role of religion in Vietnam as devotees perform their daily prayers.\n" +
                                "Next, visit a local wet market where vendors offer everything from live seafood to housewares, have a Vietnamese coffee at one of the city's busiest cafés, and then hop back in your air-conditioned vehicle for a visit to Reunification Palace, the former seat of government for South Vietnam.\n" +
                                "After a walk past the boutiques of Dong Khoi Street, wander around Nguyen Hue Boulevard to see beautiful old buildings such as the Notre-Dame Basilica, Municipal Theatre, and Central Post Office, as well as the skyscraper of Bitexco Tower. At Ben Thanh market, your guide can help you haggle for T-shirts, ceramics, sundries, and souvenirs.\n" +
                                "Get lunch at a local restaurant before you head back to your hotel for a couple hours of down time before the tour resumes in the evening.\n" +
                                "A delicious night is waiting as you jump on the back of a motorbike and jet around to some favorite eateries throughout the bustling city. You can enjoy some local culture with seafood, Vietnamese crepes, and sweet soups accompanied by beer or rice wine until it's time to retire to your hotel."

The My Khe Beach area was first flung into the spotlight thanks to the My Khe Beach television show broadcast on American networks highlighting US Vietnam War soldiers enjoying rest and play in Da Nang. After the war, the beach became a well-known spot on the backpacker trail before heading upmarket to today's more glamorous resort scene. My Khe Beach benefits from being perfectly located at the heart of World Heritage sites - the ancient port of Hoi An, the mysterious Phing Nga Caves, the home place of the Champa population and the revered imperial city of Hue are all easily accessible. My Khe Beach is also reaping the rewards of an increasing number of international flight connections from Singapore, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City to name a few.",
                                decription: "Considered to be Vietnam's most picturesque beach, the white sandy 20-mile stretch of My Khe Beach was named by the American troops who visited during the Vietnam War for R&R. It offers excellent surfing from September just off the shores of Danang. There are also a number of high-end resorts within the vicinity should you be in need of pampering with most offering a rich choice of treatments at their spas and a range of dining options. Sunbathing and surfing aside, there are a host of historical sites situated close by including the port of Hoi An which is only 10 minutes away by bus and offers wonderfully preserved merchant houses and small alleyways to explore. Hoi An is also a superb place to get anything you desire tailor made usually within 12 hours, and while you wait it’s definitely recommended that you try some local delights including very fresh shrimp pancakes.",

                                hightligh: "According to ancient folklore, a dragon emerged from the water on Non Nuoc Beach and laid an egg. A thousand days and a thousand nights followed before the egg hatched, and out stepped a beautiful girl. The fragments of the shell were left on the beach and eventually grew into the five mystical Marble Mountains. Today, one of the most popular highlights is climbing up the Marble Mountains and enjoying spectacular views across Non Nuoc, also known as My Khe Beach. The Mountain of Water which is home to pagodas dating back to the 17th century and a number of caves is one the most frequented climbs with a steep hike up stone steps to Tam Quan Gate and its superb vistas to Mount Kim Son or Metal Mountain and the coastline from the Riverview Tower located next to the gate. The Riverview Tower dates back to the 18th century and the reign of the Emperor Minh Mang. Close by is Van Nguyet Grotto which is a nice resting spot where you can grab a fresh coconut to drink. The Lantern Cave is also worth a look, small but deep and filled with lava along with Am Phu Cave which heads down to a very scenic viewpoint. Remarks: You should allow up to four hours to explore all of Marble Mountains so its good to start early when it is not so hot and of course wear comfortable shoes, and if you can, bring a torch. Vietnamese children sell souvenirs at Marble Mountains and you can expect to be hassled until you've either bought a gift or 'tipped' them a few dollars for a 'guided tour'. Price Range: There is a $1 entrance fee to Marble Mountain and an additional $1 cost for entrance to the cave at the foot of the mountains",
                                decription: "A cluster of five hills made from limestone and marble, Marble Mountains are a well-known pilgrimage site with peaks, caves, tunnels and temples all just waiting to be discovered. Named after the elements metal, wood, water, fire and earth, Marble Mountains exist in a coastal area that is renowned for stone-cutting and sculpture about 9km south of Danang. The caves within the mountains hold many secrets including bullet holes from when troops used to spy on the US soldiers relaxing on My Khe Beach below and buildings standing within the caves and grottoes. There are also a host of Buddhist sanctuaries and places of worship dotted across the mountains which are a much-visited spiritual site. There are many pagoda temples and even a special circular cave featuring a chimney leading to the summit with spectacular panoramic views.",

However, the journey is well-worth the effort as you’ll be greeted with panoramic views of Hi Van Mountain, Cham Island, Da Nang City and Son Tra Peninsula. Meanwhile, hiking enthusiasts can enjoy the verdant jungle trails and also spot rare species such as rhesus macaques, long-tailed macaques, pygmy slow loris, and red-shanked douc langurs. It takes about four hours of moderate hiking from Bai Bac Beach to the mountain summit.",

It’s a 35-minute drive from Da Nang, making it a popular retreat amongst locals and travellers looking to escape the heat and busy traffic of the city. Locally known as the Son Tra Peninsula, the verdant mountain is also surrounded by pristine beaches such as Bai Bac, Bai Nam, Bai But, and Tien Sa Beach. Monkey Mountain was a prominent observation base during the American-Vietnam War, housing two radar domes that are now taken over by the Vietnamese military as well as a helicopter pad, which makes for a cool lookout point.",

On weekends and annual festivities, the state-of-the-art bridge is also scheduled to spit water or breathe fire from its mouth from 21:00 onwards. There are also plenty of riverfront bars, restaurants, and cafes offering terrace seats that overlook Vietnam’s longest bridge. Alternatively, you can opt to sit at the waterfront (where marble carvings of animals and deities are set along the Han River) to enjoy the view.",

Measuring at 666 metres in length, it is located in Da Nang City and constructed in the shape of a golden dragon. The six-lane bridge crosses the Han River, serving as direct routes to My Khe Beach and Non Nuoc Beach as well as a popular spot amongst travelling photographers. Dragon Bridge was officially opened in 2013 after a two-year-long construction, commemorating the 38th anniversary of Da Nang City’s liberation. According to local beliefs, which date back to the Ly Dynasty, the dragon is a significant symbol of power, nobility and good fortune.",

Prior to the construction of the Hai Van Tunnel, the mountain pass was notorious for its fair share of fatal accidents – look out for small altars set along the roadside that are dedicated to perished victims. A motorcycle trip between Da Nang and Hue through Hai Van Pass takes between three and five hours, longer if you stop for seafood and coffee along the coastline. Priced between VND 150,000 to VND 200,000 per day, motorbikes can be rented from numerous hotels and tour operators in Da Nang City. Aside from requiring the use of a powerful bike, do note that Hai Van Pass motorcycle tours can be challenging for new riders – expect uphill slopes, an average temperature of 17°C, and rainy weather if you’re travelling between the months of September and March. Driving licenses are required by law and do check your insurance to see if you’re covered before… if not, go at your own risk!",
                                decription: "Hai Van Pass or Sea Clouds Pass offers an impressive landscape of verdant mountains and clear blue skies, overlooking Da Nang City, Tien Sa Port, Son Tra Peninsula, and South China Sea. Crossing over a spur of Truong Son mountain range between Thua Thien-Hue Province and Da Nang City, it stands at 500m above sea level, making it the highest pass in Vietnam. The 25 kilometre-long mountain pass is popular amongst thrill-seeking motorcyclists due to its winding roads, sudden curves and blind corners, while its lookout point offers gorgeous views of Da Nang Bay.",

                                hightligh: "The Kingdom of Champa governed Southern Vietnam from 192 A.D to 1697 and left behind a legacy of unique Cham motifs and Hindu-flavoured architecture defining this period. Examples of this style can be seen in the temples and towers decorating the coastal and mountain areas of Quang Nam, Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan, Khanh Hoa and Danang which is where the museum is also situated. The museum itself is also a fine example of Cham architecture with flowing simple lines, designed by the French architects Delaval and Auclair. Most of the artwork in the museum from this period takes the form of sculpture with a decidedly feminine feel and was gathered from Quang Binh up to Binh Dinh prior to the Cham Museum opening at the end of the 19th century. In addition to the abundance of Hindu-influenced pieces there are also some that have evidently drawn inspiration from Buddhism including altars and deities. This range in religion reflects the eight centuries of Champa life from its start through to its height and then decline, with some of the more decadent pieces coming from the Champa golden age.",
                                decription: "With their roots dating back as far as 192 AD, Vietnam's indigenous Cham people lived an Indian way of life in both culture and language. The Cham Museum in Danang is dedicated to this period and the Champa existence which began predominantly in the coastal areas of Vietnam. Housing the largest exhibition of Cham sculpture in the world, the museum displays almost 300 terracotta and stone works of art ranging from the 7th to the 15th centuries. Many of the exhibits are considered masterpieces of their field showcased according to the region in which they were found with a total of ten separate interior exhibition rooms. All of the sculptures on display fall into one of the following sections – icon, pedestal, pediment, or fragment, with the area in which they were found determining where they are exhibited. When you've finished browsing the internal creations, step outside to appreciate the building itself carefully crafted with objects of worship including idols and holy animals surrounded by flowers, leaves and turrets all symbols of Hinduism.",

Spend an entire day exploring the park's expansive grounds including a visit to Do Quyen Waterfall and the Hai Vong Dai promontory, and dine on a delicious lunch at a local restaurant.\n" +
                                        "Get picked up from your Hue hotel and head south along Lang Co Bay. After a brief journey, arrive at the park gates and begin exploring Bach Ma National Park's 54,363-acre (22,000-ha) grounds. Lauded for its steep mountain faces and dense forests, the park is a nature-lover's haven with a dizzying variety of native species.\n" +
                                        "Follow along as your knowledgeable guide leads you to Do Quyen Waterfall where you can glimpse thundering falls charting a forceful course through a wooded mountain. Enjoy a savory lunch at a nearby restaurant inside the park. Then, head to Hai Vong Dai—a lovely observation point where you can revel in panoramic views of the East Vietnam Sea.\n" +
                                        "Finally, take a leisurely stroll through the park, keeping your eyes peeled for wildlife including langur, macaque, and deer. Before your memorable excursion is through, chat with your guide about Bach Ma's history, and learn about its origins as a national park dating back to 1986."

Spend an entire day exploring the park's expansive grounds including a visit to Do Quyen Waterfall and the Hai Vong Dai promontory, and dine on a delicious lunch at a local restaurant.\n" +
                                        "Get picked up from your Hue hotel and head south along Lang Co Bay. After a brief journey, arrive at the park gates and begin exploring Bach Ma National Park's 54,363-acre (22,000-ha) grounds. Lauded for its steep mountain faces and dense forests, the park is a nature-lover's haven with a dizzying variety of native species.\n" +
                                        "Follow along as your knowledgeable guide leads you to Do Quyen Waterfall where you can glimpse thundering falls charting a forceful course through a wooded mountain. Enjoy a savory lunch at a nearby restaurant inside the park. Then, head to Hai Vong Dai—a lovely observation point where you can revel in panoramic views of the East Vietnam Sea.\n" +
                                        "Finally, take a leisurely stroll through the park, keeping your eyes peeled for wildlife including langur, macaque, and deer. Before your memorable excursion is through, chat with your guide about Bach Ma's history, and learn about its origins as a national park dating back to 1986."

You're soon pedaling through the streets of Da Nang toward the Linh Ung Pagoda on the Son Tra Peninsula.

You're soon pedaling through the streets of Da Nang toward the Linh Ung Pagoda on the Son Tra Peninsula.

As you browse incredible sculptures, learn from your guide about the Champa Kingdom, which reigned in southern Vietnam from 192 to 1697 AD, and identify the Hindu motifs that define Cham architecture.\n" +

                                        "In the morning, greet your personal guide in your hotel and get familiar with your bike. You're soon pedaling through the streets of Da Nang toward the Linh Ung Pagoda on the Son Tra Peninsula. As you approach, the pagoda's enormous statue of the Goddess of Mercy comes into view, along with the lush Marble Mountains in the distance. Spend time admiring the Buddhist site and the incredible architecture of the place before pedaling on.\n" +

As you browse incredible sculptures, learn from your guide about the Champa Kingdom, which reigned in southern Vietnam from 192 to 1697 AD, and identify the Hindu motifs that define Cham architecture.\n" +

Absorb the bustle of local life as you stroll through the outdoor market, and get the chance to try freshly made local specialties from tempting stalls before cycling back to your hotel."

During this time, maybe our two cats, Sriracha and Shiro can lend a helping paw to your handicraft :) After we finish with our own creations, we\'ll take you to have a delicious local lunch nearby where we\'ll discuss the growing local art, design and creative community in Saigon.',

We will walk, jog, run, and talk about the city, the people, the history, and maybe even entrepreneurship, which is something I have taken on, full blast. Lastly, 100% of all proceeds will go towards a local charity.',

With this experience, I will share with you the early hours that I love so much in this city, a unique perspective that no tour companies offer. And if you remind me, I can share with you how I ended up running with Airbnb\'s co-founder, Nate, as captured in the photos.',
